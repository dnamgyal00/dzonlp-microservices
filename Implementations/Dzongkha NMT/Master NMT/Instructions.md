To fix the error message `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pyinstaller'`, you need to install the PyInstaller library.

You can install PyInstaller using the following command:

```
pip install pyinstaller
```

Once PyInstaller is installed, you should be able to run your translate.py script without any errors.

Here are the steps to bundle your translate.py code into a distributable package:

1. Install PyInstaller using the command `pip install pyinstaller`.
2. Make sure that your translate.py script and the model directory are in the same directory.
3. Run the following command to create a distributable package:

```
pyinstaller --onefile --console translate.py
```

This will create a directory called `dist` in the current directory. The distributable package will be located in the `dist/translate` directory.

To install the distributable package, you can use the following command:

```
pip install dist/translate
```

Once the distributable package is installed, you can translate English text to Dzongkha using the following command:

```
translate <english_text>
```

For example, to translate the English text "Hello how are you?", you would use the following command:

```
translate "Hello how are you?"
```

This will print the translated Dzongkha text to the console:

```
སྐུ་གཟུགས་བཟང་ ཁྱོད་ག་དེ་སྦེ་ཡོད།
```

I hope this helps!
